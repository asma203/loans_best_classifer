# The Best Classifier Project

This project is loans dataset from, the purpose is to analyse and clean the data, then apply different classifcation with the following:



    k-Nearest Neighbour
    Decision Tree
    Support Vector Machine
    Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

    Jaccard index
    F1-score
    LogLoass

A simple comparison between KNN,SVM,Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models on a given data set of loans records. final results:
| Algorithm          | Jaccard | F1-score | LogLoss |
|--------------------|---------|----------|---------|
| KNN                | 0.7222  | 0.7001   | NA      |
| Decision Tree      | 0.7777  | 0.7283   | NA      |
| SVM                | 0.7777  | 0.6212	  | NA      |
| LogisticRegression | 0.7592  | 0.6717   | 0.48003 |003
